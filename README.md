# ⏱️ Digital Stopwatch using Verilog HDL and FPGA

This project presents the design and implementation of a **digital stopwatch** using **VHDL** and synthesized for **FPGA deployment**. The stopwatch is capable of measuring and displaying elapsed time in seconds and milliseconds with Start, Stop, and Reset functionalities.

Designed using structural modeling and simulated in Xilinx Vivado, the project showcases fundamental digital design practices and real-time hardware operation on an FPGA board.


## Features

- Start, Stop, and Reset functionality using push buttons  
- 4-digit seven-segment display output (MM:SS format)  
- Clock divider for generating 1 Hz signal from 50 MHz FPGA clock  
- Modular design using structural Verilog  
- Fully synthesized and tested on FPGA hardware  
- Simulation and resource reports included  


## Tools and Technologies

- VHDL
- Xilinx Vivado
- Basys 3 FPGA board
- Seven-segment display
- Push buttons (Start, Stop, Reset)
